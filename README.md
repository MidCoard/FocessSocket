# FocessSocket - A Communication API Based on Socket

This API is used to communicate with other framework for Focess. I made this API public because communication in this API is really easy.

# Development

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>top.focess</groupId>
    <artifactId>focess-socket</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```
